Running: npm run build:github
** must have github pages activarted and configured.

Github pages requires the build be in a certain directory, docs, or root.

So github pages must be configured to use the docs directory before running the deployment.

The script first removes the docs directory, and then rebuilds it with the new build.

The new build first copies all the need files into the docs directory.

Then process the text using gsed to adjust the pathing of the hrefs and srcs. to remove the ../images and ../styles

Finally, the script runs the deployment to github pages.
